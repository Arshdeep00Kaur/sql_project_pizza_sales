2. **Calculate the total revenue generated from pizza sales.**
3. **Identify the highest-priced pizza.**
4. **Identify the most common pizza size ordered.**
5. **List the top 5 most ordered pizza types along with their quantities.**

### Intermediate Queries:
1. **Join the necessary tables to find the total quantity of each pizza category ordered.**
2. **Determine the distribution of orders by hour of the day.**
3. **Join relevant tables to find the category-wise distribution of pizzas.**
4. **Group the orders by date and calculate the average number of pizzas ordered per day.**
5. **Determine the top 3 most ordered pizza types based on revenue.**

### Advanced Queries:
1. **Calculate the percentage contribution of each pizza type to total revenue.**
2. **Analyze the cumulative revenue generated over time.**
3. **Determine the top 3 most ordered pizza types based on revenue for each pizza category.**
